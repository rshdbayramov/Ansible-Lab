ansible all -m ping

If you need privilege escalation (sudo and similar) to run a command, pass the become flags:

# as bruce
$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce
# as bruce, sudoing to root (sudo is default method)
$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce --become
# as bruce, sudoing to batman
$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce --become --become-user batman
