We can define multiple conditions such as reboot the box if OS is Debian or Ubuntu but skip all other operating systems as follows using a logical OR with when clause as follows:


#Examples1
tasks:
  - name: Reboot Debian or Ubuntu Linux box
    ansible.builtin.command: /sbin/shutdown -r now
    when: (ansible_distribution == "Debian" ) or (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu")



    
    and : Boolean and
    or : Boolean or
    not : Boolean negation
